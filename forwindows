To run locally on Windows (I'm on Windows 10), I recommend adding the following to your package.json file.

 "scripts": {
    "test": "cd ./node_modules/karma/bin/ && karma start"
  },
Then from the command line, type npm run test

I prefer to not install a cli globally for these kinds of tools and instead run them locally from my project using a script. This way I can quickly see what version is in the dev dependencies and don't have to worry about the global version being different from the local one.

"devDependencies": {
    "karma": "^1.4.0"
 }
